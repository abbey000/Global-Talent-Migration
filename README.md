# Global-Talent-Migration
Analysis of trends in global migration using World Bank &amp; LinkedIn Data

## PROJECT MOTIVATION
Talent is a key resource in a knowledge economy. Talented individuals hold jobs that are vital for innovation & technological progress and ultimately contribute to stronger economic growth. 
Transnational movements of talent have existed as long as nation-states. Over the past 20 years, enhanced links among countries through globalization has enabled the rapid expansion of transnational talent flows in both scope and scale. 
The four most common forms of international talent migration were overseas study and employment, skilled migration, periodic migration and return of talent1.

## DATA BACKGROUND
The dataset is part of the LinkedIn - World Bank Group partnership, which helps governments and researchers understand rapidly evolving labor markets with detailed and dynamic insights. 
It shows the movement of LinkedIn Members across the world at the country, industry and skill level
It allows leaders to benchmark and compare labor markets across the world; analyze skills, occupations, migration, and industries; and leverage real-time data to make policy changes.
The metrics and data are a product of the partnership and cover industry employment, skill, and migration metrics for over 100 countries. 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
There exists a huge global skill shortage; unfortunately, this is only going to increase. By 2030, there will be a global human talent shortage of more than 85million people. This could result in $8.5trillion in unrealized annual revenues2. Advanced countries (like Canada) will be most affected by this trend. 
A deep understanding of the global talent migration trends is required to address the skill shortage.

## PROJECT PROPOSAL
Our analysis aims at investigating the trends in global talent migration with a view to determine the gainers and losers.
It will help leaders identify the source of top, in-demand talent. Insights gained can be used to develop suitable policies to attract them.
Major beneficiaries are: Political & Business Leaders, Policy makers, Global HR managers.

## PROJECT SCOPE
LinkedIn has better coverage of white-collar workers. Hence, our analysis will focus majorly on knowledge intensive service sectors.
The migration flows covered are an unlikely representative of the entire migration landscape.

## ANALYSIS QUESTIONS
1) What is the overall trend of migration? 
2) Which countries have highest and lowest net migration in 2015 and 2019?
3) Where are the professionals moving to and from? 
4) What are the most popular industries at global level? Which countries are gaining and losing in these industries?
5) Which are the most popular skills at global level? Which countries are gaining and losing in these skills?
6) Focus on Canada   
  a) What is the origin of professionals moving to Canada?  
  b) Where are Canadian professionals moving to?  
  c) What are the top 10 industries for migration to Canada?  
  d) What are the top 10 skills for migration to Canada?  

## DATA DESCRIPTION  
Three CSV files with numeric, double and character(categorical) datatypes  
   a)Country Migration 4148 observations, 16 variables, NaN – 9 Columns  
   b) Industry Migration 5295 observations, 12 variables, NaN – 17 Columns 
   c) Skills Migration 17617 observations, 11 variables, NaN – 3,030 Observations, 17 Columns  
Data was obtained from World Bank Data Catalog
Dataset included data from 2015-2019
Transformation steps:   
   i) Empty rows and columns were deleted from original data.  
  ii) Subsets of regions, popular industries and popular skills were created for preliminary visualisation.   
Inclusion criteria: To conduct analysis, we will be using all three metrics (Country, Industry and Skills)  

## SUMMARY
### Global  
Though there is a huge migration from low income to high income countries, there is still significant migration from high income to high income countries(e.g. France to Luxemburg) and also high income to low income countries(e.g. UK and US to Gabon and Congo D.R.)  

### Canada  
Canada is gaining significantly from the global talent migration. The country is a top destination for professionals with the following skills – AI, Development Tools, Data Storage, Computer Graphics and so on.
Even though some Canadian professionals are moving abroad, the trend is very minimal compared to foreigners coming in.  

## RECOMMENDATION  
Though emigration of Canadian professionals is very low, further investigation is needed to understand which industries and skills account for this trend. Our dataset is limited to destinations countries (Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, Lexembourg, Denmark and Cambodia)
